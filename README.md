A simple simulation of mcts tree search<br>
A not-so correct MCTS algortithm is applied. <br>
The aim is to simulate strategy game resource management.<br>
A modified UCT function that averages several varaibles is used as tree policy:<br>
By adding parrallel tree structure, this method search down different trees simultanously. Each tree corresponds to a unit (soldier, hero, farmer). The idea is naive and needs further developments.
